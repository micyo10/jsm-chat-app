Chat App using Socket.io, Node.js, and React

Socket.io: https://socket.io/
Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
React: https://reactjs.org/

A personal project using a video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwFA3YMfkoc

My goal was to better familiarize myself with the React library,
while at the same time, creating a fun application

To run the application:
In two separate commant prompt windows, run 'npm start' for both client and server directories

client will run on localhost:3000
server will run on localhost:5000

With love,

Mike
